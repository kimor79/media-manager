Media Manager is a suite of tools and libs meant
to automate the management of your media library.

The basic flow is:

   * Query torrent sites for new media
   * Inject torrent into torrent client (ie transmission)
   * Put newly downloaded media into proper format
     for reading by a media player (ie plex)
